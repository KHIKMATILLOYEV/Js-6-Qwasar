## Operations on strings
#### In this guide, we will look at the basic operations on strings and their use as a developer. 
Strings are arrays of characters and are an important part of many applications, especially those related to the user interface.
## Iterating through the characters of a string
One of the main ways to work with strings is to iterate through its characters. In most programming languages, strings are immutable, which means that the characters in a string cannot be changed directly. However, you can iterate over the characters of the string to perform various operations.

## Basic operations on strings
In addition to iterating over characters, there are many other operations that can be performed on strings. Here are some of them:

### 1. String length
Often you may need to find out the length of the string. Most programming languages provide a function or property to determine the length of a string.

### 2. Combining strings
Sometimes you may need to combine two strings into one. This can be done using the "+" operator or special functions.

### 3. Substring extraction
Sometimes you may need to get a part of the string extracted from the original string. This can be done using the substring extraction operation.

### These are just some of the basic operations on strings. There are other functions and methods.
